						The term vastu is derived from the word "vasa" meaning habitat. In sanskrit vastu is referred as the site fit for construction.Vastu finds its origin in Esthapatya Veda which in turn is a part of Atharva veda one of four vedas. The vedas are originally said to have been spoken by God at the time of the formation of prakruti. Trillions of years ago, this knowledge was transferred from generation to generation. Books became a necessity at the dawning of the iron age 5000 years ago, when people memories began to rapidly deteriorate. So the necessity of compilation of vedas felt & rishi ved vyas did the job. 
					The ancient example of vastu are iron pillar of Qutub Minar, Konark Temple, Jagannath Temple, Old fort etc. 
					Vedas covers the knowledge of all domain of life like farming, metallurgy, artillery, architecture,customs etc. The set of architectural guideline given in Vedas is Vastu. Vastu is therefore better defined as an Ancient Architecture of Vedic Architecture. 
					Vastu is controlled by different pattern of energies. So it is not only the matter form i.e concrete structures, but the energy i.e Aura of the place which is taken care in Vastu Vidya. So Vastu examination extends  far beyond the physical level in and around your home. 
					It is one of the ancient teachings from the Indian civilization. Vastu is a science, it deals with the arrangement of the Five elements of nature. 
					The universe is made of the five elements of nature ie.
						1. Earth
						2. Water
						3. Air
						4. Fire
						5. Space
					These five elements with there presence must also be in harmony with each other in human dwelling. Any imbalance of these elements in our internal & external vastu transform into an unhappy situation. Vastu teaches the individual to live in harmony with the five elements for peace & prosperity.
